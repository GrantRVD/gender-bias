Reading for gender bias
Implicit gender bias in evaluations and letters of recommendation negatively impacts women at every stage of their career. The goal of this project is to create a web-based text-mining tool that scans and reveals language bias associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation written for trainees and applicants. Bringing awareness to the existence of implicit bias may impact how evaluations/letters for women are drafted and judged, thereby providing a concrete way to tackle gender disparities.
