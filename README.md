## What is the project about?

### The problem

* Gender disparities exist in medicine, science, business, and many other careers
* Letters of recommendation and evaluations written for women differ in key ways from letters written for men
* The differences impact everything from how women are graded in a class to whether they are hired or promoted 
* Most writers (men and women) are unaware of gender bias in their writing 

So, even if someone wants to write a really strong letter for a women, they will probably include language that reflects [implicit bias][link_implicitbias], which weakens the letter.

### The solution

Reading for Gender Bias is a web-based text analysis tool that:

* Scans evaluations or letters and reveals language associated with bias
* Summarizes changes that would reduce bias
* Increases awareness of gender bias
